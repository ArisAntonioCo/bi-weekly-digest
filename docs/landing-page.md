so rather than a broader, AI-powered investment tool
8:43
our app very specifically

leverages battel-tested frameworks from well-known/world-class investors ((Bill Gurley, Brad Gerstner, Stanley Druckenmiller, Mary Meeker, Beth Kindig)
in order to precisely project [base/bull/bear case] 3-Year MOIC projections
and assess equity durability or, said differently, vulnerability to a market correction or pullback

@channel does that make sense?  So basically it's a pretty narrow tool.  If you want to see what experts would think about Google stock, and how they'd think about what it could be worth in 3 years, including how risky it is ... then we are perfect
if you want general finance, investment advise, we are not the tool
