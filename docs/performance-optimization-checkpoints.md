- [ ] Initial page load under 2 seconds
- [ ] Database queries under 200ms
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Smooth interactions

### Rollback Plan:
Each checkpoint is independent and can be reverted individually if issues arise. Keep the previous commit hash before each checkpoint for easy rollback.

### Next Steps:
1. Monitor performance metrics for 1 week
2. Gather user feedback on perceived performance
3. Address any edge cases or regressions
4. Plan next optimization phase based on data

**Note:** After each checkpoint, run the full test suite and do manual testing before committing. Each checkpoint should leave the application in a fully functional state.
